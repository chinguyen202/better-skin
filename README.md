Better Skin is an skincare application, which can be used by everyone who want to improve their skin condition.
By answering some questions about your skin type and your skin goals, the application will suggest you a morning
and evening skincare routine together with general instructions on how to use that type of product.
Currently, the application is preloaded with products from one brand: The Inkey List.
